# Why do i have a stickshift!
You can always drive an automatic but you will never enjoy driving as much as a stickshift racer does. Same is true for your camera.


## Chapter 1 has to get to business
My vision for the book is same as types of books i like and what my daughter calls the interleaves. A beautiful image on the right and little text on the left that drives home the point. Yes, I am a minimalist.

I may like a square book. 8x8. Hardbound.

I guess the most difficult thing will be to string the small pieces together.

It is also difficult to say what the book will turn out to be about though I start out as a book on photography in manual mode.

This line will not be in the book because i will abandon the branch these changes will be committed to.
